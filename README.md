This project looks at a data set from Kaggle and uses various modeling methods to accurately predict a person's emotion based on social media usage metrics, as well as metrics about the person. The types of models covered are **linear regression models**, **lasso and ridge regression** models, and a **random forest classifier**. The relationship between the predictors and response proved to be non-linear, and the predictors showed signs of collinearity. This made random forest classifier far outperform the other methods, due to its robustness to both of these factors, and its combination of multiple decisions trees.
